Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Q1 Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of creating, maintaining and testing software for different purposes.

Importance of software to the technology industry cannot be overemphasized, software is used for automation, streamlining various operation in industry, collecting feedback from various stakeholders and planning a robust services for product end users.

Q2 Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Changing technology: some software development tools are becoming obsolete due to the changes that is occurring in this industrial revolution

2. User need: It is sometimes difficult to meet the various need and preferences of the software end users. Creating a versatile software may be a tedious task to overcome.

3. Software security: the software are prone to attack from invaders if they are not well maintained and tested before deployment.


Q3 List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Unit level: This is the basic level that involve developing each module of the software application accurately

2. Integration level: This is the combination or merging of different module.

3. System level: The previous level will form a system, in this phase the software ready for testing.

4. Deployment: This is the phase that users can use the software while it is being modified base on users feedback.

Q4 Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a horizontal and sequential methodology. It is not flexible. It does not support the modification of a module after it has been concluded.
It is best appropriate when there is need to meet the deadline of a short time frame project and when developer expert are available.

While agile methodology provide flexible processes for the accomplishment of various modules and its integration with other modules.
It is best to ensure accuracy and proper testing of results.

Q5 Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a. Software developer is responsible for creating the software base on the requirements, he collaborate with different stakeholders to accomplish his task. He is responsible for making changes to the software whenever he is ordered by the project manager

b. Quality assurance engineer monitors the quality of the output of the software developer, he provide the software developer with strategies and procedures to ensure that the requirements of the software is needed. He also engage with clients to better understand their preferences.

c. Project manager lead the software development team, he take notes of contracts, assign the best personnel and allocate funds to the project. He is responsible for making the final decision on the suitability of a developed software.

Q6 Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) refer to the platform that provide software tool that can be use for writing, editing and modifying code by software developers. Example include Visual Studio Code VScode.
Its importance include: automatically completing codes, automatically modifying fonts and color, suggesting and completing various commands, changing codes from human readable format to computer or machine readable format and vice versa.

2. Version Control System (VCS) is used by developers to control different variation  or version of software it is use to keep up with changes. Example include git.
VCS is important because it allows for collaboration on project, it can be use to track changes and progress, it can be use to revise or reverse error, It support multiple work on a project from different developers.

Q7 What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges face by software engineers include.
1. Constant change in technology.
Solution: by applying new trends
2. Software attack
Solution: by investing cyber security
3. Insufficient fund
Solution: by starting with smaller project.
4. Users changing need:
Solution: by requesting for detailed description from the clients

Q8 Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing: This is the basic testing that involve testing each module of the software application accurately. 

2. Integration testing: This is the testing of the combination or merging of different module.

3. System testing: This the testing of the whole system operation, in this phase the software is ready for deployment. 

4. Acceptance testing: This is testing for acceptance after users feedback, users can use the software while it is being modified base on users feedback.
   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Q9 Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompting engineering is the process of formating constructive queries with clear description in order to obtain accurate and  desired result from the AI models or machines.
Importance of prompt engineering
1. Generating accurate results
2. Saving time and energy
3. Avoiding misleading responses
4. Controlling large firms with effectivess
5. Streamlining task. Etc.
   
Q10 Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt 
Draw the map of Nigeria 

Improved
Draw the map of Nigeria while indicating the six geopolitical zones and natural resources.

Improved prompt is more effective as it provide accurate and clear response or result to the query or prompt.
